Apartment Residential Management System 

## Description

This is a client project i worked on for a 3 week group project in thoughtworks. 

The client had trouble managing thoughtworkers into apartments who are comming into Singapore and had to manually key in details into a giant excel spreadsheet where details were cluttered and unmanagable. 

Together with 4 other members we worked closely with the client using agile methodology where we captured estimate and planned user stories based on priority and value given to the client.



## Features 

The user can add new apartments and occupants to the list of apartment and occupant page. 

Each aparment lists out the apartment details such as lease date and the user can assign an occupant to the apartment based on the capacity of the apartment.

The user can assign the occupant to the aparment based on the maximum number of capacity of the apartment. 

Each occupant detail showcases which apartment they have stayed in and their check in and check out date. 



## How the team worked

we worked in sprints , in each sprint 4 days were given to work on the features and the last day we have a feedback session with the client to demonstrate what we have done and to have feedback on things we can improve.

For each user story we worked in pairs where 2 pairs will work on a user story and a single person will be the quality assurance/dev ops for the project where they will setup circle ci and write cypress test for deployment.

Each day we rotated pairs so that everyone will understand what each person is doing and to have two set of eyes for our code. 


## Challenges faced 

The biggest challenge faced doing the project is to work collaboratively in sync with one another and understanding each person personality you work with to prevent misunderstanding and arguments

Given that  everyone had their own ways of doing things things ended up being chaotic doing the first week. 

There problems faced were lack of communication which caused our build to fail doing the first week

The biggest problem we had  was that the main component in App.js had been refactored 4 times due to people's ego which slowed down our pace for the project. 


## How the challenges were overcomed

We sat down and had a team retro where we list out the things we should and not continue doing and to discuss the issues we were facing to improve as a team doing so helped us as a team understand the flaws that has been happening.

We also give ourselves personal feedback and had a team bonding session to understand each other personality. 

The above things done has helped us tremedously and we improve as a team 

within the second week and there were more collaboration and communication involved andwe were more productive and we were able to push out more features.

## What i learned. 

One of the key takeaway i learned in the project is that programming skills is only half of what any programmer need. Being able to work in a team collaboratively requires good communication and listening skills. 

I've also learned how to start with the simplest approach and work your way up methodologically, this way we dont overegineer our solution.
